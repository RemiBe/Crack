"""A Hypergraph H = (V,E) is a set of vertices/nodes (V) and a set of
hyperedges (E included in P(V), where P(V) is the set of all parts of
V). Therefore, a hyperedge can have an arbitrary number of ends.

A Hypergraph is a dictionary defining the fields:
- entity: 'hypergraph'
- nbr_n: int: The number of Nodes.
- nbr_e: int: The number of Hyperedges.
                   a node
           ,----------'-----------,
- nodes: ( ((int, ...), (int, ...)), ... )
            '---.----'  '---.----'
            neighbors     edges

- edges: ( (int, int, ...), ... )
           '------.------'
             a hyperedge
The "nodes" key stores in cell i the neighbors and the hyperedges of
the ith node.
The "edges" key stores in cell i the ends of the ith hyperedge.
We use tuples to have a fast access to the ngbrs/hyperedges of a node,
because we assume that the hypergraph will not change.

Optional fields are:
- dimns: int: The Geometrical dimension of the Hypergraph
- coord: ((float, ...), ...): The coordinates of the Nodes
NB: these fields are initialized by the init_HypergraphGeometry function.

Example:

    Consider the Hypergraph:

      0     1
      ,- 1 --- 2
    0-+  +-----'
      '- 3    2

    Then the corresponding dictionary is:
>>> hypergraph_key = {
        "entity": "hypergraph",
        "nbr_n": 4,
        "nbr_e": 3,
        "nodes": (
            ( (1,3    ), (0,0    ) ), # node 0 has 2 neighbors
            ( (0,2,2,3), (0,1,2,2) ), # node 1 has 3 neighbors,
                                      # but 2 appears in two hyperedges
            ( (1,1,3  ), (1,2,3  ) ), # node 2 has 2 neighbors
            ( (0,1,2  ), (0,1,1  ) ), # node 3 has 3 neighbors
        ),
        "edges": (
            (0,1,3),
            (1,2),
            (1,2,3),
        ),
    }
